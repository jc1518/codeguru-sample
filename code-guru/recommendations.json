The iterable object for the loop expression is calculated once and remains unchanged despite any index changes caused by the sequence modification. This might lead to unexpected bugs. If you need to modify the sequence, it is recommended that you first make a copy, such as by using slice notation.\n\n[Learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement)",
